		The idea behind the dedicated servers is so that we can race in hotlap events that we choose, without having to be online at the same time.
		The dedicated servers will automatically update this website with the best lap times you do.
	</p>
	<p>
		The PC the dedicated servers run on will not running 24/7. You can, however, boot the PC yourself.
		The status of the servers is on the Server Status Page. This page details if the dedicated servers are online, their current session status and 
		the names of any drivers racing on them. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If the PC is not running, there will be a link on the status page to enable you to power it up.
	</p>
	<p>
		The PC will automatically shutdown after 90 minutes of no driver activity (long enough to make sure the current session is recorded).
	</p>
	<p>
		The servers output live data during each session, as well as record historic data.

		At the end of a session, each driver's best time for that session is recorded. Your best time from every session you take part in is recorded, however the hotlaps page only 
		shows the fastest time achieved by a driver. Click on a driver's lap time to view all historical session times for that driver.
